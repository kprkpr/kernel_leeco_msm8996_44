# WIP Kernel 4.4 for LeEco Le Max 2 (X820/821/829)

This is a try to port kernel 4.4 to LeEco Le Max 2 from 3.18 one


## Changes from 3.18 in build things..

Much of defconfig MSM flags are "mainlined" as QCOM flags in kernel 4.4, then, old defconfig it's a bit difficult to parse

Legacy interfaces may be obsoleted in 4.4 like some from I2C, I fix for ex. the ANX7418 one, but may be more while adding to defconfig

Seems that IIO defconfig flags are needed for build

It can build with 4.9 and 9.x GCC, but while not boots, I recommend using GCC 4.9

## TODO

- Fix qpnp-charger merge (That now lives in drivers/power/supply/qcom). After merge, doesn't compile. Errors about 

- Fix some non referenced functions in build

- Fixing new defconfig (At least, know what drivers are not there, to add it)

- Make it boot
